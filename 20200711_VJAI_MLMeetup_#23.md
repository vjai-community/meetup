- Chủ đề:  Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation
- Speaker: Nguyen Sy Quan  - VJAI
- Abstract: 
Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task.
The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters
or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view,
while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. 
DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation,
where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to every pixel in the input image.
Deeplab uses Spatial pyramid pooling and Atrous Separable Convolution to imporve segmentation task effectively. 
DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries.
